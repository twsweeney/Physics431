## Python-examples
Example notebooks showing how to do different things with Python and associated libraries.

### [A brief tour of Python & some libraries](A%20brief%20tour%20of%20Python%20%26%20some%20libraries.ipynb)
This gives an overview of some aspects of the Python language that may be unfamiliar to those who have learned other programming languages, such as mutable versus immutable data types, the concept and features of an "object" as a data structure, and a few examples to illustrate.

Then the notebook gives some quick examples of how to read data sets into Python, how to plot and fit a simple line, how to plot with error bars, and finally how to fit a line with full uncertainty calculations.

### [Composite Model Demo with LMFit](Composite%20Model%20Demo%20with%20LMFit.ipynb)
Example shows how to construct a multiparameter fitting function from LMFit Models. Here, a fit is made to two spectrum peaks plus a linear background.

### [Exploring uncertainty propagation with Python](Exploring%20uncertainty%20propagation%20with%20Python.ipynb)
This notebook is part of a lecture that shows how uncertainty propagation calculations relate to predicting the statistical distribution of a calculated experimental value from the statistical distributions of the quantities that went into the calculation.  Also shows the use of the [Uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/) package.

### [Python Use Examples by Olmstead and Pengra](Python%20Use%20Examples%20by%20Olmstead%20and%20Pengra.ipynb)
A comprehensive collection of examples of using Python and various libraries to carry out data analysis tasks.  Almost any standard data analysis step (reading in data, manipulating data arrays, printing, making tables, propagating ucertainty, plotting, line fitting, etc. is here.  Originally written by Prof. Marjorie Olmstead, with additions and a table of contents by David Pengra.  (Note, the internal links only work when the notebook is loaded into an active Jupyter session.)

### [Uncertainties Quick Start](Uncertainties%20Quick%20Start.ipynb)
If all you want to do is see how to use the [Uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/) package, look here.  The examples also show how to combine uncertainties from various sources and calculate how much uncertainty each source contributes to the final value.
